# Simple Graph

This project will get us started and make some room for experimetation with graphing using python libraries. The goal is to make a simple template for plotting an arbitrary fuction over some range. 

The following should be user inputs:
- a function to plot
- the range over which to plot it
- labels for the graph, x-axis and y-axis

There are several graphing libraries available for python, I like the looks of [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) for adding interactivity down the line.
