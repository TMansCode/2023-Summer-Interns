# Kinetic Energy

In this experiment we will explore the concept of [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy). This is a form of energy due to its motion. 

To calculate the kinetic energy of an object, we need to know:
* mass of object - typically expressed in kilograms
* velocity - or speed of object, typically expressed in meters/second
* kinetic_energy = 1/2 * mass * velocity^2

Conversions to understand:
* pounds to kilograms - lbs/.4536
* miles per hour to meters/second - mph/.4470

Consider four vehicles, the first two are electric vehicles ([EV](https://readysetrev.com/how-much-do-electric-vehicles-weigh))  and the second two are gas-powered-vehicles ([GPV](https://carspecs.org/vehicle-weight/))  and have the following curb weights, and (*the weight of the car/truck without passengers etc*):
1. Kia EV6 - 4,502 lbs
2. Ford F-150 Lightning 6,015 lbs
3. Fiat 500 Pop X AWD - 3,305 lbs
4. Dodge Charger GT RWD - 4073 lbs

 We want to understand how much kinetic energy, each vehicle has at different speeds:
1. 15 mph - school zones
2. 45 mph - in town roads with no pedestrian traffic
3. 65 mph - highways

Please print a table showing the four vehicles (rows) and their kinetic energy (columns) at each speed above.
